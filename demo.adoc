= Build Micro Frontends for Java Microservices

Today, I'll show you how to build a microservices and micro frontends architecture with JHipster. You'll build a gateway with Spring Cloud Gateway. Then, you'll create a blog microservice and a store microservice, each with its own database. Each app will also contain a micro frontend.

**Prerequisites**:

- https://sdkman.io/[Java] 11+
- https://nodejs.com/[Node.js] 16+
- https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/[Docker Desktop]
- https://www.jhipster.tech/installation/[JHipster] 7.9.3

== Micro frontends in action with JHipster

. Install JHipster 7:
+
[source,shell]
----
npm i -g generator-jhipster@7
----

. Run the following command to create a new directory for your micro frontends project:
+
[source,shell]
----
take micro-frontends-jhipster
----

. Download both the `reactive-ms.jdl` and `reactive-mf.jdl` files and compare them in IntelliJ IDEA. You'll need IDEA's https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/working-with-the-ide-features-from-command-line.html[Command-line Launcher] for the `idea` command to work.
+
[source,shell]
----
jhipster download reactive-ms.jdl
jhipster download reactive-mf.jdl
idea diff reactive-ms.jdl reactive-mf.jdl
----
+
TIP: The https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/19697-jhipster-jdl[JHipster JDL Plugin] is a handy tool for working with JDL files.

=== Build Java microservices with Spring Boot and WebFlux

. To generate a microservices architecture with micro frontend support, run the following command:
+
[source,shell]
----
jhipster jdl reactive-mf.jdl --monorepository --workspaces
----

. If you want to use Angular, append `--client-framework angularX` to override the JDL value:
+
[source,shell]
----
--client-framework angularX
----

. If you'd rather try out Vue, use the following:
+
[source,shell]
----
--client-framework vue
----

=== Run your reactive Spring Boot microservices

. When the process is complete, cd into the `gateway` directory and start Keycloak and Consul using Docker Compose.
+
[source,shell]
----
cd gateway
docker compose -f src/main/docker/keycloak.yml up -d
docker compose -f src/main/docker/consul.yml up -d
----

. Run `./gradlew` (or `npm run app:start` if you prefer npm commands).

. Open the root directory in IntelliJ IDEA and view each project's code structure.

. Open your favorite browser to `\http://localhost:8080`, and log in with the credentials displayed on the page.

. Show missing links in entities menu.

. Start the `blog` by opening a terminal and navigating to its directory. Then, start its database with Docker and the app with Gradle.
+
[source,shell]
----
npm run docker:db:up
./gradlew
----

. Open a new terminal and do the same for the `store` microservice.

. Verify everything is started using Consul at `\http://localhost:8500`.

. Refresh the gateway app to see menu items.

=== Zero turnaround development that sparks joy

What if you want to work on the UI and have zero turnaround that sparks joy? ‚ú®ü§ó

. In the gateway app, run `npm start`. This command will run the UI on a web server, open a browser window to `\http://localhost:9000`, and use https://browsersync.io/[Browsersync] to keep your browser in sync with your code.

. Modify the code in `gateway/src/main/webapp/app/modules/home/home.tsx` to make a quick change. For example, add the following HTML below the `<h2>`.
+
[source,html]
----
<h3 className="text-primary">
  Hi, I'm a quick edit!
</h3>
----

. You'll see this change immediately appear within your browser. Remove it, and it'll disappear right away too.

. Open another terminal, navigate into the `store` directory, and run `npm start`.

. Modify files in the `store/src/main/webapp/app/entities/store/product` directory, and you'll see the changes in your browser immediately.
+
For example, change the wrapper `<div>` in `product.tsx` to have a background color:
+
[source,html]
----
<div className="bg-info">
----
+
The UI will change before you can kbd:[Cmd+Tab] back to your browser.

NOTE: The backend has quick turnaround abilities too, thanks to https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/using.html#using.devtools[Spring Boot devtools]. If you modify a backend class, recompiling it will cause Spring Boot to reload your component lickety-split. It's pretty slick!

=== A look under the hood of micro frontends

When you're learning concepts like micro frontends, it's often helpful to look at the code that makes things work.

The gateway's `webpack.microfrontend.js` handles setting up the `@blog` and `@store` remotes and specifying the shared dependencies and components between apps.

The blog's `webpack.microfrontend.js` looks similar, except that it exposes its `remoteEntry.js`, menu items, and routes.

== Build and run with Docker

. Build Docker images for each application by running the following command from the root directory.
+
[source,shell]
----
npm run java:docker
----
+
TIP: For Apple Silicon, use `npm run java:docker:arm64`.

. Navigate to the `docker-compose` directory, stop the existing containers, then start all the containers.
+
[source,shell]
----
cd docker-compose
docker stop $(docker ps -a -q);
docker compose up
----

. To make Keycloak work, you must add the following line to your hosts file (`/etc/hosts` on Mac/Linux, `c:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\hosts` on Windows).
+
----
127.0.0.1  keycloak
----

. Prove everything works at `\http://localhost:8500`

. Run Cypress e2e tests from the root directory:
+
[source,shell]
----
npm run e2e -ws
----

== Switch identity providers

JHipster ships with Keycloak when you choose OAuth 2.0 / OIDC as the authentication type. However, you can easily change it to another identity provider, like Auth0!

. First, register a regular web application. Log in to your Auth0 account (or https://auth0.com/signup[sign up] if you don't have an account). You should have a unique domain like `dev-xxx.us.auth0.com`

. Select *Create Application* in the https://manage.auth0.com/#/applications[Applications section]. Use a name like `Micro Frontends`, select *Regular Web Applications*, and click *Create*.

. Switch to the *Settings* tab and configure your application settings:

- Allowed Callback URLs: `\http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/oidc`
- Allowed Logout URLs: `\http://localhost:8080/`
+
Scroll to the bottom and click *Save Changes*.

. In the https://manage.auth0.com/#/roles[roles] section, create new roles named `ROLE_ADMIN` and `ROLE_USER`.

. Create a new user account in the https://manage.auth0.com/#/users[users] section. Click the *Role* tab to assign the roles you just created to the new account.
+
IMPORTANT: Make sure your new user's email is verified before attempting to log in!

. Navigate to  **Actions** > **Flows** and select **Login**. Create a new action named `Add Roles` and use the default trigger and runtime. Change the `onExecutePostLogin` handler to be as follows:
+
[source,js]
----
exports.onExecutePostLogin = async (event, api) => {
  const namespace = 'https://www.jhipster.tech';
  if (event.authorization) {
    api.idToken.setCustomClaim('preferred_username', event.user.email);
    api.idToken.setCustomClaim(`${namespace}/roles`, event.authorization.roles);
    api.accessToken.setCustomClaim(`${namespace}/roles`, event.authorization.roles);
  }
}
----

. Select **Deploy** and drag the `Add Roles` action to your Login flow.
+
CAUTION: Want to have all these steps automated for you? Vote for https://github.com/auth0/auth0-cli/issues/351[issue #351] in the Auth0 CLI project.

. Edit `docker-compose/central-server-config/application.yml` and append the following YAML block to add your Auth0 settings. [`jh-oidc-a0`]
+
[source,yaml]
----
jhipster:
  security:
    ...
    oauth2:
      audience: https://<your-auth0-domain>/api/v2/
spring:
  security:
    oauth2:
      client:
        provider:
          oidc:
            issuer-uri: https://<your-auth0-domain>/ # make sure to include the trailing slash!
        registration:
          oidc:
            client-id: <your-client-id>
            client-secret: <your-client-secret>
----

. Stop all your Docker containers with kbd:[Ctrl+C] and start them again.
+
[source,shell]
----
docker compose up
----

. When everything is started, navigate to `\http://localhost:8080` and click **sign in**. You will be prompted for your Auth0 credentials.

If you'd like to use Okta for your identity provider, see https://www.jhipster.tech/security/#okta[JHipster's documentation].

[TIP]
====
You can configure JHipster quickly with the https://cli.okta.com[Okta CLI]:
[source,shell]
----
okta apps create jhipster
----
====

== Deploy with Kubernetes

The JDL you used to generate this microservices stack has a section at the bottom for deploying to Kubernetes.

----
deployment {
  deploymentType kubernetes
  appsFolders [gateway, blog, store]
  clusteredDbApps [store]
  kubernetesNamespace demo
  kubernetesUseDynamicStorage true
  kubernetesStorageClassName ""
  serviceDiscoveryType consul
  dockerRepositoryName "mraible"
}
----

If you have a Kubernetes cluster created, you can deploy to its `demo` namespace using the following command.

[source,shell]
----
./kubectl-apply.sh -f
----
